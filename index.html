        <h1>You Got This</h1>
        <p>
            I had to keep reminding myself of this as I re-learned how to create and publish a live website — almost entirely on my own. 
            With only a faint memory of HTML from past experiences, I pushed through after completing my Global Career Accelerator course where I earned multiple certifications.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Content Section -->
    <div class="content">
        <h2>Certifications Earned</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>AI Professional Skills Certification</strong> — The Global Career Accelerator (Sep 2025)</li>
            <li><strong>Intercultural Skills Certification</strong> — The Global Career Accelerator (Sep 2025)</li>
            <li><strong>UX/UI & Prototyping Certification</strong> — The Global Career Accelerator (Sep 2025)</li>
            <li><strong>Data Visualization Certification</strong> — The Global Career Accelerator (Aug 2025)  
                <br><em>Skills: Data Analytics</em>
            </li>
            <li><strong>SEO Essentials</strong> — Semrush (Aug 2025)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            After facing the challenges of building this site from scratch, I was reminded of the full-body reward that comes from perseverance — 
            that same satisfying ache after pushing through something you once believed couldn’t be done. 
            It reminded me of training for my black belt in Taekwondo, mastering routines as a flyer in cheer, 
            and fighting for every win in Academy League soccer. In all those moments, what pulled me through was belief.

            Just like in sport, you don’t always have every answer — but if you show up, commit, and push forward with purpose, 
            you realize: <strong>You Got This.</strong>
        </p>

        <h2>Nothing Is Impossible</h2>
        <p>
            This experience has deepened my connection to adidas' message. 
            It’s not about perfection — it’s about persistence. 
            It’s about finding the strength to continue even when doubt creeps in. 
            That’s what <strong>"Impossible Is Nothing"</strong> means to me. 
            It's the mindset that pushes boundaries, both physical and mental.
